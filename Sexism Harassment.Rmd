### <u>Introduction</u>

```{r}
load(file = "Results_Sexual_Harassment.RData")
```

In a 2019 study, *Jonathan Burnay*, *Brad J Bushman*, and *Frank Lar√∏i* attempted to find out if sexualized video-games increased the level of sexual harassment players would display to others online (Or more specifically, they wanted to test if it affected how the participants would react when communicating with someone <font color= "48A955">anonymously</font>.) The experiment itself was conducted over Skype's text-chat feature.

Just to display the general idea of what the participants were looking at, This is an example of the kinds of outfits that a character would be wearing for the participants who had been placed in the group chosen to play the <font color= "A94848">"Modestly Dressed"</font> characters:

And in this next image, is an example of the kinds of skins that participants would be playing with if they had been assigned to the group chosen to play as <font color= "A94848">"Scantily Dressed"</font> characters. You may notice that the character on the right side is the same character from the examples above, just to display how drastic the difference was, even if the participant were to have played the same character:

The study's two hypotheses were:

- The level of online sexual harassment behavior, especially toward women, will increase after playing a sexualized video game
- Male players should be more likely than female players to sexually harass a real female after playing a sexualized video game

The first hypothesis turned out to be correct. Sexual harassment towards women did increase after players had participated in playing the sexualized version of the game. The second hypothesis however, was inaccurate. Both male and female players were just as likely to sexually harass females after playing the sexualized version of the game. Though the results of the study did not cover this, It is interesting to note that participants were more willing to sexually harass males over females in general, and participants were more likely to harass males when they were playing the non-sexualized version of the game than when they were playing the sexualized version.

Here is a sample of the data collected:

```{r}
example_table <- table |>
  select(-("VGDifficulty":"VGviolent"))
kable(head(example_table,10 , caption= "Data Collected"))
```

I only included the first 10 participants to give a general idea, as the true dataset had 211. I also removed the columns that were unnecessary to explain the end goal of the study. The original chart had categories for the participant's rating on game difficulty, realism, violence, excitement, frustration, competitiveness, fun, and difficulty level. Though there may be a correlation in these, the main study didn't seem to focus on them much and most likely had them as potential covariates.
