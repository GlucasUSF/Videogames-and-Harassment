### <u>Introduction</u>

```{r}
load(file = "Results_Sexual_Harassment.RData")
```

In a 2019 study, *Jonathan Burnay*, *Brad J Bushman*, and *Frank Lar√∏i* attempted to find out if sexualized video-games increased the level of sexual harassment players would display to others online (Or more specifically, they wanted to test if it affected how the participants would react when communicating with someone <font color= "48A955">anonymously</font>.) The experiment itself was conducted over Skype's text-chat feature.

Just to display the general idea of what the participants were looking at, This is an example of the kinds of outfits that a character would be wearing for the participants who had been placed in the group chosen to play the <font color= "A94848">"Modestly Dressed"</font> characters:

And in this next image, is an example of the kinds of skins that participants would be playing with if they had been assigned to the group chosen to play as <font color= "A94848">"Scantily Dressed"</font> characters. You may notice that the character on the right side is the same character from the examples above, just to display how drastic the difference was, even if the participant were to have played the same character:

The study's two hypotheses were:

- The level of online sexual harassment behavior, especially toward women, will increase after playing a sexualized video game
- Male players should be more likely than female players to sexually harass a real female after playing a sexualized video game

The first hypothesis turned out to be correct. Sexual harassment towards women did increase after players had participated in playing the sexualized version of the game. The second hypothesis however, was inaccurate. Both male and female players were just as likely to sexually harass females after playing the sexualized version of the game. Though the results of the study did not cover this, It is interesting to note that participants were more willing to sexually harass males over females in general, and participants were more likely to harass males when they were playing the non-sexualized version of the game than when they were playing the sexualized version.

Here is a sample of the data collected:

```{r}
example_table <- table |>
  select(-("VGDifficulty":"VGviolent"))
kable(head(example_table,10 , caption= "Data Collected"))
```

I only included the first 10 participants to give a general idea, as the true dataset had 211. I also removed the columns that were unnecessary to explain the end goal of the study. The original chart had categories for the participant's rating on game realism, violence, excitement, frustration, competitiveness, fun, and difficulty level. Though there may be a correlation in these, the main study didn't seem to focus on them much and most likely had them as potential covariates. 

As for the categories left in the graph, The code is the participant's unique number, NS or S under sexualization represent whether or not the participant was placed in the sexualized or non-sexualized condition. Partner and participant gender simply state the sex of the participant and the person they were sending jokes to. Age is self-explanatory, but player and Hourweek represent if the participant normally plays video-games, and how many hours per week they may spend doing so. They also mention their level of familiarity with the game.

The HS, BS, GA, and ODS categories represent the participant's scores on various tests of sexism or aggression prior to the test beginning. (These represent Hostile Sexism, Benevolent Sexism, Trait Aggression, and Online Disinhibition).

### <u>Personal Alterations</u>

When taking the original study into account, There were many variables that had been included, however I don't believe they had been examined to the true extent they could have been. In this section, I will attempt to analyze the data and the provided covariates to see if the level of anger the participant felt while playing the game, may have had any correlation to their level of sexism. Being someone who is well-versed in the video-game community, I'd be willing to hypothesise that participants who rated the game higher in *difficulty*, *frustration*, and *competitiveness* are more likely to make sexist remarks than those who seemingly enjoyed the game and rated it higher in the *fun* category.

I also believe that the gender of the person the sexist remarks are focused at could play a large role in how many sexist jokes are told by the participant. In order to make this data easier to view, I wanted to separate only the conditions in which a female partner was selected. The study mainly focused on female sexualization in video games, so I believe this data would be more reliable and consistant than the male data.

```{r}
  table_long <- pivot_longer(table,
             c(VGDifficulty:VGviolent), names_to = "Ratings", values_to = "Values")|>
  select(-("Player":"USFIVPlayer"))

  table_long2 <- table_long[,c(1,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11)]|>
     filter(partnergender == "F")

kable(head(table_long2,21 , caption= "Data Collected"))
```

This version of the table shows each individual value of how the participants labelled The game's difficulty, frustration, competitiveness, fun,excitement, realism, and violence. I only chose to show data from the first three participants, as this grouping of data would be very large with how many participants had taken part in the study. However, these results were very interesting to look over. 

Though the results drastically differed between subjects, there did seem to be a connection between How frustrating the subject rated the game, how much fun they had playing the game, and the number of sexist remarks they made. However, it is important to note that this correlation was heavily moderated by the scores the participants had on the aggression, sexism, and online dis-inhibition scales. Even if a participant was frustrated by the game, and lacked any enjoyment from the experience, they were still less likely to make sexist remarks if their scores on the scales were low. Inversely, even if someone greatly enjoyed the game, and lacked any frustrating moments, there was still a chance of them choosing to tell more sexist jokes if their scores on the scales were higher.

This relation between frustration and fun experienced by the test subjects seems to be proportionally related: for example, if a subject has a high level of frustration, a higher level of fun also seems to help prevent them from making as many sexist jokes. In the same way, even if a subject had no fun with the game, a lower level of frustration would also lead to them making fewer sexist jokes. The main expectation is that a large disparity between the level of frustration and fun ranked by the participants could lead to higher chances of sexist jokes being told. 

However, this claim cannot be made for certain, as there would need to be a test specifically designed for this question. As it currently stands, there is a connection between how enjoyable one's experience of a video game is and thier level of sexism towards women, even apart from the level of sexist propaganda the game itself may show.
